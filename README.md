## Course-1 : What is Data Science?
### Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do
In this module, you will view the course syllabus to learn what will be taught in this course. You will hear from data science professionals to discover what data science is, what data scientists do, and what tools and algorithms data scientists use on a daily basis. Finally, you will complete a reading assignment to find out why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century.
### Data Science Topics
In this module, you will hear from Norman White, the Faculty Director of the Stern Centre for Research Computing at New York University, as he talks about data science and the skills required for anyone interested in pursuing a career in this field. He also advises those looking to start a career in data science. Finally, you will complete reading assignments to learn about the process of mining a given dataset and about regression analysis.
### Data Science in Business
In this module, you will learn about the approaches companies can take to start working with data science. You will learn about some of the qualities that differentiate data scientists from other professionals. You will also learn about analytics, story-telling, and the pivotal role data scientists play in creating an effective final deliverable. Finally, you will apply what you learned about data science by answering open-ended questions.

## Course-2: Tools for Data Science
### Data Scientist's Toolkit
In this module, you will get an overview of the programming languages commonly used, including Python, R, Scala, and SQL. You’ll be introduced to the open source and commercial data science tools available. You’ll also learn about the packages, APIs, data sets and models frequently used by data scientists.
### Open Source Tools
In this module, you will learn about three popular tools used in data science: GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, and RStudio IDE. You will become familiar with the features of each tool, and what makes these tools so popular among data scientists today.
### IBM Tools for Data Science 
In this module, you will learn about an enterprise-ready data science platform by IBM, called Watson Studio. You'll learn about some of the features and capabilities of what data scientists use in the industry. You’ll also learn about other IBM tools used to support data science projects, such as IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog, Data Refinery, and the SPSS Modeler.
### Final Assignment: Create and Share Your Jupyter Notebook

## Course-3: Data Science Methodology
### From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection
In this module, you will learn about why we are interested in data science, what a methodology is, and why data scientists need a methodology. You will also learn about the data science methodology and its flowchart. You will learn about the first two stages of the data science methodology, namely Business Understanding and Analytic Approach. Finally, through a lab session, you will also obtain how to complete the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stages and the Data Requirements and Data Collection stages pertaining to any data science problem. 
### From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
In this module, you will learn what it means to understand data, and prepare or clean data. You will also learn about the purpose of data modeling and some characteristics of the modeling process. Finally, through a lab session, you will learn how to complete the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation stages, as well as the Modeling and the Model Evaluation stages pertaining to any data science problem.
### From Deployment to Feedback
In this module, you will learn about what happens when a model is deployed and why model feedback is important. Also, by completing a peer-reviewed assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a problem that you define.

## Cours-4: Python For Data Science
This course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours—no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills. 
By the end of this course, you’ll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python. You’ll gain a strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, and develop skills to help advance your career.
