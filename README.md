## Course-3: Data Science Methodology
### From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection
In this module, you will learn about why we are interested in data science, what a methodology is, and why data scientists need a methodology. You will also learn about the data science methodology and its flowchart. You will learn about the first two stages of the data science methodology, namely Business Understanding and Analytic Approach. Finally, through a lab session, you will also obtain how to complete the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stages and the Data Requirements and Data Collection stages pertaining to any data science problem. 
### From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
In this module, you will learn what it means to understand data, and prepare or clean data. You will also learn about the purpose of data modeling and some characteristics of the modeling process. Finally, through a lab session, you will learn how to complete the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation stages, as well as the Modeling and the Model Evaluation stages pertaining to any data science problem.
### From Deployment to Feedback
In this module, you will learn about what happens when a model is deployed and why model feedback is important. Also, by completing a peer-reviewed assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a problem that you define.

## Cours-4: Python For Data Science
This course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours—no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills. 
By the end of this course, you’ll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python. You’ll gain a strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, and develop skills to help advance your career.

## Course-5: Databases and SQL for Data Science
### Introduction to Databases and Basic SQL
In Week 1 you will be introduced to databases. You will create a database instance on the cloud. You will learn some of the basic SQL statements. You will also write and practice basic SQL hands-on on a live database.
### Advanced SQL
By the end of this module, you will learn the following: (1) Learn how to use string patterns and ranges to search data and how to sort and group data in result sets. (2) Learn how to work with multiple tables in a relational database using join operations.
### Accessing Databases using Python
After completing the lessons in this week, you will learn how to explain the basic concepts related to using Python to connect to databases and then create tables, load data, query data using SQL, and analyze data using Python
### Course Assignment
As a hands-on Data Science assignment, you will be working with multiple real world datasets for the city of Chicago. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data scientist would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.

## Course-6: Data Analysis with Python
Learn how to analyze data using Python. This course will take you from the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data. You will learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

Topics covered:

1) Importing Datasets
2) Cleaning the Data
3) Data frame manipulation
4) Summarizing the Data
5) Building machine learning Regression models
6) Building data pipelines

 Data Analysis with Python will be delivered through lecture, lab, and assignments. It includes following parts:

Data Analysis libraries: will learn to use Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset. We will introduce you to pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Then we will introduce you to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
